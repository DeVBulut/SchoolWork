# üßë‚Äçüéì SchoolWork

This repository contains my coursework from two major computer science classes at Southern Utah University:

- **CS-1410: Object-Oriented Programming in Java** *(Instructor: Dr. Nathan Barker)*
- **CS-2420: Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures** *(Instructor: Dr. Nathan Barker)*

Each section showcases assignments and exercises demonstrating my progress in Java programming, object-oriented design, and foundational data structures and algorithms.
